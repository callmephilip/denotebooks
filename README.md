ðŸ¦• Deno by Example, in Notebooks!

~~Most~~ Some of these examples are borrowed from [Deno by Example](https://examples.deno.land/) to showcase notebooks in Deno.

Please contribute some! I use these while testing the Deno Jupyter kernel and developing [display](https://github.com/rgbkrk/display.js).
